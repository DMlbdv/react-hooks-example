## The story

As a user I would like to view information about a city.

I should be able to select a city from a list and see:

- a graph with the relevant timeseries data
- the city name
- the status
- the highest and lowest values from the timeseries data

## Setup  

`$ npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode<br />
Open [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) to view it in the browser.`
